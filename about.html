				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<h5>Ross Da Boss</h5>
				<br/>
				<h2>Our Organization</h2>
				<p>
					&emsp; Ross Conspiracies Inc. is a site where a few trusted authors
					have got together and decided to voice our opinions on a few
					things. Mainly about conspiracies such as Squirrels are really
					government spies, the Earth is flat, and other various things.
				</p>
				<p>
					&emsp; Usually, when people hear <i>conspiracy</i>, they think 
					about a bunch of whackjobs that are paranoid about getting 
					sucked up in an extra-terrestrial’s spaceship (this is actually
					a legitimate concern), and then the aliens bring the guy back 
					down to Earth and promptly leave with no trace of ever being 
					there. That isn’t what we are about. Instead of telling everyone 
					about the spaceship and letting the public demoralize us, we find 
					enough clues that we really did get sucked up into the spaceship, 
					and the aliens were real. Generally the public says “low resolution 
					pictures of the sky in black and white aren’t proving your theory”, 
					but what do they know? The aliens didn’t pick them up.
				</p>
				<p>
					&emsp; We not only have conspiracy theories, but we also have a lot of ideas
					on what you can do to prevent the government from reading your mind, 
					how to cure yourself from wrinkle nose syndrome (carried by plutians, 
					and makes you look permanently disgusted), how broccoli wasn’t ever 
					meant to be eaten, and so on and so on.
				</p>
				<p>
					&emsp; A few of our better known articles are “8 Ways Goats Affect Your Health; 
					You Won’t Believe Number 5!”,  “Seriously Though, Why are the Aliens 
					Doing This?”, and “Mircowaves: Brain Fryers”. A few of our best 
					authors are Luke Groundwalker, Brian Flyers, Wally Mart, and Jane.
				</p>
